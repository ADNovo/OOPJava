**Project Summary**

The goal of this project was to build a simple text game in which the player gets to guess a movie title given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies). The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows the player how many letters it's made up of. The goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time. 
If a letter is indeed in the title the computer will reveal its correct position in the word, if not, the player loses a point. If the player loses 10 points, the game is over.
